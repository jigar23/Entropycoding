Entropycoding
=============

Huffman | Shannon-Fano | Adaptive Huffman

This code takes an input file in binary format (image, audio, text etc.),reads the data byte by byte,  prepares the
frequency chart based on the statistics of the file and prepares a codeword for each of the symbol.

Codewords can be generated by using any of the following coding methods:
1. Huffman 
2. Shannon Fano
3. Adaptive Huffman

To execute the code,
just run the file main.cpp and follow the instructions on the screen.

IMP:
Refer the report EntropyCoding.pdf for detailed implementation of the code.
